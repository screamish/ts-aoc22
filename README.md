# Advent of Code 2022 in typescript

Trying out the AoC22 in typescript. I forked a ts-cli starter kit I found that looked relatively simple to get started with.
Super rusty at ts, time to see if I can force myself to get a bit more familiar.

## Usage

### **dev**

`npm run dev`

Runs the CLI application.

You can pass arguments to your application by running `npm run dev -- --your-argument`. The extra `--` is so that your arguments are passed to your CLI application, and not `npm`.

### **clean**

`npm run clean`

Removes any built code and any built executables.

### **build**

`npm run build`

Cleans, then builds the TypeScript code.

Your built code will be in the `./dist/` directory.

### **test**

`npm run test`

Cleans, then builds, and tests the built code.

### **bundle**

`npm run bundle`

Cleans, then builds, then bundles into native executables for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Your shareable executables will be in the `./exec/` directory.
